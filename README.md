#### Replication experiment of Couture, M., Lafond, D., & Tremblay, S. (2008). [Learning correct responses and errors in the hebb repetition effect: Two faces of the same coin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18444753/) *Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition*, 34(3), 524-532.

This repository contains all the material used to conduct the experiment and perform the statistical analysis, as well as the final report itself.

* **HEBBsetup** - Setup for the experiment; includes .exe for both conditions, AudioFirst and VisualFirst
* **HEBBdata** - Raw output data from the subjects 
* **Data Divsion** - Script to divide the output data from each condition
* **HEBBdataDivided** - Divided output data from the subjects
* **Data Extraction** - Script to preprocess the data for the correct answers and errors analysis
* **Data Analysis** - Jupyter Notebook with the data analysis performed for the replication
* **Replication of Couture et al. (2008)** - Written report

Theoretical accounts to mind and brain must undergo the rigorous examination conducted by experimentalists in the fields of Psychology and Cognitive Sciences. The rationale behind this experimental work is to gather representative data that could either support or confute the hypotheses stemming from a given theory. Research in these fields has a long standing tradition and led to important advances and discoveries about the mind, brain and behavior. Nevertheless a recent study published on the leading scientific journal Science reported that out of 100 psychological experiments conducted within the year 2008, only the 30% could be successfully reproduced. The issue of reproducibility in scientific research is a hot topic, rising the need for accurate and critical thinking and rigorous methodology applied to experimental design routines, data analysis and outcome interpretation. 

The aim of this final project is to address one of the articles included in the reproducibility study and conduct an experiment that could either support or falsify the original hypothesis of the target paper. In addition, you will introduce a variation on the original experimental design (i.e. an extra experimental condition) to overcome its possible limitations or extend its implications.
